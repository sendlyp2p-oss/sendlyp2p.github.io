  <h1>Pricing Structure</h1>

  <p>
    Sendly follows a transparent, activity-based pricing structure.
    Charges are derived from the nature of work involved rather than
    bundled or arbitrary rate cards.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our pricing is built around three distinct components, reflecting
    how effort and cost behave across document preparation and pre-mailing activities.
  </p>

  <h2>Layer 1: Setup & Preparation Charges (Fixed / One-Time)</h2>

  <p>
    These charges apply to activities where effort is front-loaded and
    largely independent of dispatch volume.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Document design and layout setup</li>
    <li>Template creation or standardisation</li>
    <li>Initial document formatting</li>
    <li>Proofreading and content consistency checks</li>
    <li>Address data structure review</li>
    <li>First-time variable data setup</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These charges are typically applied per document type or template
    and do not increase proportionally with the number of articles.
  </p>

  <h2>Layer 2: Execution & Pre-Mailing Charges (Quantity-Based)</h2>

  <p>
    This layer covers manual, labour-driven activities where effort
    increases directly with the number of articles processed.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Address placement and alignment</li>
    <li>Label or barcode handling</li>
    <li>Folding of documents</li>
    <li>Insertion into envelopes</li>
    <li>Sorting and bundling by destination or grouping</li>
    <li>Batch segregation and tagging</li>
    <li>Manual verification and quality checks</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Charges under this layer scale with quantity, as they involve
    physical handling and manual effort.
  </p>

  <h2>Layer 3: Printing Charges (Volume-Optimised)</h2>

  <p>
    Printing-related costs are influenced by volume and resource utilisation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Black & white printing</li>
    <li>Colour printing</li>
    <li>Paper usage</li>
    <li>Machine utilisation and finishing</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    At higher volumes, printing costs may reduce on a per-unit basis
    due to improved operational efficiency.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is Not Included in Sendly’s Pricing</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Postal tariffs or postage charges</li>
    <li>Booking or acceptance at postal counters</li>
    <li>Delivery timelines or guarantees</li>
    <li>Tracking assurance or postal service performance</li>
    <li>Statutory charges levied by third parties</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Postal charges are governed by applicable postal regulations and
    are payable as per prevailing tariffs.
  </p>

  <h2>How Quotations Are Provided</h2>

  <p>
    After reviewing your requirement, a detailed quotation is shared
    outlining applicable setup charges, execution charges, and printing costs.
  </p>

  <p>
    This ensures clarity, transparency, and alignment with the actual
    scope of work involved.
  </p>

  <p>
    Indicative postal tariff information is available separately on the
    <a href="tariff.html">Postal Tariff – Reference Only</a> page.
