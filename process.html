  <h1>Our Process</h1>

  <p>
    Sendly follows a structured, step-based approach to ensure clarity,
    accuracy, and readiness at every stage of document preparation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each stage is executed with defined responsibility boundaries and
    controlled handling of client information.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Requirement Confirmation</h2>
  <p>
    We begin by understanding the scope of work, document type, volume,
    timelines, and preparation requirements.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Confirmation of document category and volume</li>
    <li>Understanding of preparation and personalisation needs</li>
    <li>Clarification of timelines and delivery expectations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: File Review & Preparation</h2>
  <p>
    Client-provided files and data are reviewed for print readiness,
    formatting consistency, and preparation feasibility.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Format and layout review</li>
    <li>Basic proofreading and consistency checks</li>
    <li>Address formatting and pincode reference checks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: Design, Editing & Data Handling</h2>
  <p>
    Where required, documents are structured and data is prepared
    for variable printing and personalisation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Layout structuring and template standardisation</li>
    <li>Variable data placement and verification</li>
    <li>Controlled handling of sensitive information</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 4: Printing & Pre-Mailing Execution</h2>
  <p>
    Approved documents are printed and prepared through structured
    pre-mailing activities.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Batch-wise printing execution</li>
    <li>Folding, insertion, and envelope preparation</li>
    <li>Sorting and bundling as per requirement</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 5: Dispatch Readiness & Confirmation</h2>
  <p>
    Completed articles are verified and made ready for submission
    through standard postal channels.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Batch verification before handover</li>
    <li>Internal readiness checks</li>
    <li>Confirmation of completion to the client</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Postal booking, acceptance, delivery, and tracking are governed by
    applicable postal regulations and service conditions.
